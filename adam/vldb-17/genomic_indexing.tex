% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
The advent of genomics projects that will generate hundreds of petabytes of
sequence data has spawned several projects that are investigating how to
efficiently parallelize genomics algorithms in a distributed setting.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Large datasets in genomics are pushing the bounds of traditional
data management systems, as well as HPC
\item Many genomics queries can be described as ``genome arithmetic'':
\begin{enumerate}
\item Manipulating data in the genomic coordinate space
\item ``Genome arithmetic'' was introduced in BEDtools~\cite{quinlan10}
\item ``Region join'' primitive was introduced in ADAM~\cite{nothaft15}
\end{enumerate}
\item Why are genome arithmetic queries difficult?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Queries involve range queries across a complex 2D coordinate space
\item Key distribution can be skewed
\item Need to deploy different strategies as table cardinality can vary
widely~\cite{kozanitis16}
\end{enumerate}
\item In this work, we introduce and evaluate optimized algorithms for executing
joins and aggregates in the genomic coordinate space
\begin{enumerate}
\item We use an interval array to accelerate broadcast joins, and a work-balancing
approach to accelerate sort-merge joins
\item The work-balancing approach that is used for sort-merge joins can also be
applied to aggregates
\item We implement these queries on top of \textsc{Apache Spark}~\cite{zaharia12,
zaharia10} as part of the \textsc{ADAM}~\cite{massie13, nothaft15} library
\end{enumerate}
\item Our evaluation demonstrates that these strategies improve join performance
by two orders of maginitude, leading to a $5\times$ improvement in application
runtime
\begin{enumerate}
\item We evaluate raw join performance on a set of microbenchmarks that approximate
realistic genomic datasets
\item In these microbenchmarks, we compare against flattened genomics
tools~\cite{quinlan10}, na\"{i}ve \textsc{Apache Spark} implementations,
\textsc{Spark SQL}~\cite{armbrust15}, \textsc{Apache Impala}~\cite{kornacker15},
\textsc{SciDB}~\cite{brown10, taft14}, and \textsc{TileDB}~\cite{papadopoulos16}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Genomics has been experiencing a continuous explosion in the volume of data
collected~\cite{stephens15}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sequencing costs have dropped from \$100,000,000 per genome in 2001 to under
\$1,000 per genome last year
\item Each genome is dense: raw reads are 200GB, reduced form is 10--100GB
\item Sequencing data is most useful when observed as a population, so biomedical
and biotechnical organizations are amassing datasets with more than 100,000
samples~\cite{lek16}
\item These datasets have long outgrown traditional HPC and flat analysis systems
\end{enumerate}
\item How is genomics data processed?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Most genomics data is processed in the context of a ``reference genome''
\item The reference genome is the ``average'' sequence for a given chromosome
of a species
\item Can be thought of as a set of disparate 1D coordinate spaces: each
chromosome is a 1D coordinate space
\end{enumerate}
\item What are common genomics query patterns?
\begin{enumerate}
\item ETL: preprocessing and data cleaning~\cite{massie13, nothaft15avocado}
\item Coordinate space arithmetic~\cite{quinlan10}/joins~\cite{nothaft15}
\item Aggregation queries at a specific position in the genomic coordinate plan
\item TODO: add more examples of the above
\end{enumerate}
\item What makes genomics queries expensive/difficult?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Key skew: even if the average genomic locus is covered by 60 datapoints,
the worst case locus may be covered by 50,000 datapoints~\cite{pinard06}
\item Number of records/dataset size: an average genomic dataset will typically have several
billion records, and an average dataset is several hundred GB for reads, and up to
40TB for genotypes
\item Queries are typically range based: requires novel indexing strategies
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We introduce two optimized approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A broadcast join, for applications with one low cardinality table
\item A sort-merge join, for applications with two high cardinality tables
\item Our sort-merge join uses load balancing to improve query performance
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sort-Merge Join}
\label{sec:sort-merge}

\subsection{Broadcast Join}
\label{sec:broadcast}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}
\label{sec:microbenchmarks}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Here we compare raw join performance using our two approaches with
several tools:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textsc{BEDtools}: The single node, flattened tool that is widely
used in genomics to execute these queries at the present day~\cite{quinlan10}
\item Na\"{i}ve approaches in \textsc{ADAM}: the approaches introduced
in the original \textsc{ADAM} paper~\cite{nothaft15}
\item \textsc{SciDB} and \textsc{GenomicsDB}: Two array stores that are
designed for querying genomics data~\cite{brown10, taft14, papadopoulos16}
\item \textsc{Spark SQL} and \textsc{Impala}: Two high performance SQL
implementations on top of the Hadoop ecosystem~\cite{armbrust15, kornacker15}
\end{enumerate}
\item We evaluate these systems using synthetic datasets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item These datasets emulate real world genomic data
\item We vary:
\begin{itemize}
\item Key skew and sparsity: What is the number of keys that are overloaded,
and how much are they overloaded by?
\item Interval size distribution: What is the width distribution of intervals
that we are querying across?
\item Payload: What is the density of an average item in the join? I.e., genomic
reads are ``heavy'', genomic features are ``light''
\end{itemize}
\item The datasets are described in Table~\ref{tab:microbenchmarks}
\end{enumerate}
\item Additionally, for all the tools except for \textsc{BEDtools}, we evaluate
several aggregation queries:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Aggregate: Counting read coverage per genomic locus
\item Aggregate: Computing allele frequency per variant
\item Join plus aggregate: Computing read coverage per genomic feature
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

2 & Features & 250MB & Balanced & Reads & 250GB & Skewed \\
3 & Variants & 8 GB & Balanced & Genotypes & 1TB & Balanced \\
% We should do sparklines for the key skew
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We evaluate several application kernels:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The INDEL Realigner and Base Quality Score Recalibrator from
\textsc{ADAM}~\cite{massie13, nothaft15}
\item \textsc{Avocado}'s genotyping engine~\cite{nothaft15avocado, nothaft17}
\item TBD
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Future work: cost-based optimizer for genomic queries
\begin{enumerate}
\item If we have the full query trace and statistics about the cardinality of
the input datasets, we can optimize end-to-end performance
\item Especially useful for machine learning queries: broadcast join may be
cheaper if run once, but if in a join-aggregate pattern (e.g., running a
machine learning query), sorting up-front may be more efficient
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
