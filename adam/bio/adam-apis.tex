\begin{abstract}

The detection and analysis of rare genomic events requires integrative analysis
across large cohorts with terabytes to petabytes of genomic data. Contemporary
genomic analysis tools have not been designed for this scale of data-intensive
computing. In this paper, we present ADAM, a library built on top of the popular
Apache Spark distributed computing framework. We use ADAM to recall the Simons
Genome Diversity project dataset against the GRCh38 build of the human reference
genome. Because ADAM is designed to allow genomic analyses to be seamlessly
distributed across large clusters, we achieve a 3.5$\times$ improvement in variant
calling latency and a 66\% cost improvement over current toolkits, without
sacrificing accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A big driver for extensive sequencing is detecting low frequency genomic correlations
\begin{enumerate}
\item This necessitates the joint analysis/integration of large cohorts; these datasets are
frequently too large to process on a single machine
\item The GATK provides common primitives for constructing genomic analyses~\cite{mckenna10}, but
is difficult to run in a distributed setting
\item We want to leverage the past decade of industrial development of horizontally scalable
systems~\cite{zaharia10, dean08}
\end{enumerate}
\item ADAM, provides abstractions for accessing and processing genomic data on a cluster
of commodity machines
\begin{enumerate}
\item We provide a programing framework that accelerates common genomic processing tasks, while
not limiting the algorithms that can be run
\item Algorithms are high level: shouldn't be concerned about data formats or the layout
of data on disk
\end{enumerate}
\item By taking a ``ground up'' approach, we are able to improve analysis cost by 66\%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bioinformatics analysis consumes up to 90\% of experiment costs~\cite{andrews14}
\item Our approach reduces cost by enabling the use of clusters of smaller machines, which are
more cost proportional~\cite{janapa10}
\item We demonstrate this by recalling the Simons Genome Diversity dataset~\cite{prufer14}
\item ADAM reduces cost while improving analysis time by $3.5\times$, and without sacrificing
accuracy
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
\item ADAM provides a collection-oriented view of genomic data
\begin{enumerate}
\item Operations are built on Spark's Resilient Distributed Dataset~(RDD, see~\cite{zaharia12})
abstraction, which provides a distributed, in-memory array
\item Collection-oriented view eliminates need for sort-order invariants; conflicting sort-order
invariants make it difficult to chain current genomic analysis tools together
\end{enumerate}
\item Processing pipelines are first class citizens in ADAM
\begin{enumerate}
\item Most genomic analyses are built as cascading pipelines
\item This has led to the design of many bioinformatics-specific workflow engines (e.g.,
Galaxy~\cite{goecks10})
\item Spark is natively designed to support chaining analysis steps with stronger
guarantees (fault tolerance, recomputation) by building a DAG~\cite{zaharia10}
\item Build \emph{workflows}, not \emph{workflow engines}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:supplement-architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In prior work~\cite{nothaft15}, we have described the design approach that
inspired ADAM~\cite{zaharia10}
\item ADAM uses a commodity columnar storage format to store genomic data
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the Apache Parquet~\cite{parquet} storage format, loosely based off of
Google Dremel~\cite{melnik10}
\item ADAM's formats are fully compatible with legacy genomics file formats
\item Parquet enables compression that is between BAM and CRAM~\cite{fritz11} without
incurring the costs and restrictions of reference-based compression
\item Additionally, we are able to apply these same compression techniques to
variant data, leading to a representation that is 66\% smaller than GZIP-ed VCF
\item This data is queryable from a variety of query engines~(Spark-SQL~\cite{armbrust15},
Impala~\cite{kornacker15})
\end{enumerate}
\item Many reference-based genomics algorithms can be implemented using the ``region join''
abstraction
\begin{enumerate}
\item At it's base, a ``region join'' is a relational join where key equality is determined
by the similarity of two keys in a genomic region space
\item This primitive can be used to implement many feature analysis algorithms~\cite{quinlan10}
\item To enable efficient implementations, we back our ``region join'' with a variety of
execution engines (e.g., broadcast, shuffle-based sort)
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dataset Hosting}
\label{sec:dataset-hosting}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To make it easier to use ADAM, we've developed the eggo tool that ingests datasets
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dataset descriptions are stored using Data Protocols style schema~\cite{dataprotocols}
\item Datasets are converted and stored in Amazon S3 as a public resource
\item Tool makes it easy for people to use ADAM on common genomic datasets
\end{enumerate}
\item We use eggo to drive all of the analyses in this paper
\end{enumerate}
